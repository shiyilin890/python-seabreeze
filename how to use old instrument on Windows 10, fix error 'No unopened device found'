I have an old ocean optics spectrometer (USB2000), I used seabreeze Python library to record data, and seabreeze is working fine on both my old Windows7 laptop and new Mac (macOS 10.15). However, when I tried to use seabreeze on my new Windows 10 laptop, it failed, and keep giving this error:

spec = Spectrometer.from_first_available()
File "somefile.py" 
raise cls._backend.SeaBreezeError("No unopened device found.")
seabreeze.cseabreeze._wrapper.SeaBreezeError: No unopened device found.

Actually seabreeze is installed and functional, but the driver of spectrometer is missing. The reason, based on ocean optics itself, is "Ocean Optics has not [yet] paid to have our drivers 'signed' by Microsoft for Windows 8/8.1. We did have this done for earlier versions of Windows".

The solution is to install a driver for spectrometer on Windows 10. Drivers can be found on their website:
https://www.oceaninsight.com/support/software-downloads/
Steps:
1. You can either buy a driver, or use the open source one:
"SeaBreeze Open-Source OEM Device Driver"
 download and unzip, 
2. plug in the spectrometer, open the window "Devices and Printers", you'll find the spectrometer under the tab "Unspecified", then right click choose "Properties" which opens a new window, 
3. click the tab "Hardware", click button below "Properties" which opens new window,
4. click "Update Driver" button, then choose "Browser My Computer", then select the SeaBreeze folder you just unzipped.
Now everything works!
